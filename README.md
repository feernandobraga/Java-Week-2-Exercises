Some very simple java applications coded at the start of the 2nd semester 2019 

1.  Difference of numbers
    * Write a java program to display the result of difference of two numbers. 
    A user will enter two integers. Program will calculate their difference. 
    Program then display the result
    
2.  Celsius to Fahrenheit.

3.  Area of a Circle
    *  Write a Java program to calculate the area of a circle.
  
4.  Compound interest
    * Using the compound Interest Formula A = P * (1 + r)n where A is the amount, r is the interest rate per time period, and n is the
    number of time periods. Write a Java program to calculate and display the result where P= $ 5000.00 investment; r = 4% interest rate per year; n = 10 years.
    
5. The diameter of the Sun is approximately 865,000 miles. The diameter of the Earth is approximately 7,600 miles.
Use the methods in Math class to write a Java program calculate and display:
